# Programming Language and Python

A programming language (click [here](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/programming_language.html
) for more information) is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. The most important task is to build software. There are two types of software a programming language can build: 
* Application: software for people and other applications to use. For example, Browser (Firefox, Chrome), PDF Viewer, Printer drive.
* Package/Module/Library: software for programming languages to use. For example, _pandas_ and _matplotlib_ (some python packages Michael uses in his python class homework - Michael's python program).

In the programming world, the first principle is reusing code. It's known as "Write once, use many times." However, it is impossible to have one software that can do everyone's job, because each person's job is different. It is also unrealistic for everyone to write his or her program. At least, it is inefficient in economics. The real world works in between: A software maker builds some packages, which provide general functions. Then, a software user picks the packages he needs, makes some modifications (commonly known as configurations in computer science), and puts them together to do his own job. 

In today's world, computer programming seems to be everywhere. In a sense, its like huge cake that has many layers/levels. You cannot simply say all or none. The key point for success is to eat the right piece. You will not make any software for other people to use. But you use software provided by other people. If you analyze data, you will need _pandas_ to sort them. If you want to visual data distribution, you will need _matplotlib_ to draw a graph. However, to move data between those packages to get the result you want, you must call the objects and functions provided by those packages in a program written in the same language as the one those packages written. This is your program, the piece of the cake you should eat - a program that binds your data with specific science/math packages. 

After talking about which parts of programming language you need, we should see how to get them. This is a tough job because training classes are available everywhere, including in school and on the web, and the parts you need may not match perfectly. However, you have to take some parts. Here is what I think you should pay attention to when learning a programming language:

**Language symbol, grammar, and how object is defined and used in the language**
Symbol and grammar are basics of a language. It is not hard to learn, but you need to remember them just like you need to remember words when learning a human language. An Object is one of the modern program foundations. Objected Oriented Programming (OOP), an architecture and methodology used in almost all software development, is based on modeling a part of the real world as an object in a program. It is not because you will build an object for other people to use. Instead, it is because you use other software functions by using the objects the software provides. Knowing how objects are defined and used in a language will help you to learn how to use specific scientific/math packages, like _pandas_ for data processing and _matplotlib_ for data plotting.

**Specific package** As we said before, no one can build everything, and no one needs everything to build what they want. In the future, there will be more and more software makers who provide more specific packages. And users will then use those packages instead of writing their own programs to do their tasks. Then two questions come out: 
  1. How can I find out or how do I know there are such packages?
  2. Should I use those packages or write my own program to do the same work (Because it is time consuming to learn a new package)? 

Most programming language classes will, more or less, introduce some packages. Michael's python class teaches basic usage of _pandas_ and _matplotlib_. It is a good starting point, but it is not enough. There is no good answer to the first question. But you have to face it. My recommendation is to keep your eye open, keep your ear open, and keep your mind open. If many people use the same package to do the same work you want to do, it will be a good choice for you. Google search is a good resource. 

For the second question, my experience is to use packages. You will get rewarded later if you choose to use a package. Spending time to learn a new package and comparing different packages is worth more than writing a program to do the same thing. When learning a new package, you will see many new features you never knew.
