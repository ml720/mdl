Michael, 

Use link above to see how Interface and abstract class used in this project.
It shows 

* Many classes can extend from one same class. It can be abstract (as in the project) or not. 
But one class can only extends from one super class. It cannot extends from two super classes.

* Same for interface. Many classes can implement one same interface. However 
one class can implements ##multiple## interfaces!
